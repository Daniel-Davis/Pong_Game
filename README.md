# Pong_Game
Single player pong game
Purpose: For personal project for software engineering class 2015 w/ Brian Capouch

Prompts the user with a title screen with two buttons(play, exit). User can play the game or the user can quit. If user plays the game, a game screen will pop up and the title screen will disappear. The game screen will have a delay before the game begins to allow the user time to prepare. Then balls will be launched from the right side of the screen to the left. If the user misses a ball and doesn not bounce it back, the user will lose a life(three to start off with). The objective of the game is to survive the "waves" of balls without dying. The game screen will keep track of and display: the life the user has remaining, the amount of time that has elapsed since the start of the game screen being initialized, and the score the user has(points recieved when a ball is reflected backwards).
